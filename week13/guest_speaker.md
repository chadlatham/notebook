Jason or Dan with General UI - Freemont Based Mobile App Company

Jason - Project Manager
Dan - Technical Recruiter

Paired Development:

Testing in the code should be done and looked at by both partners - not just split between each developer.

4-6 hours of coding, other time to unwind, retrospectives, and have meetings.

Focused on Native Mobile app dev. They don't like any cross-platform or web based solutions at this time.
