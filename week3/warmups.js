// Morning Warmup 5/18/16 - Sum all inclusive numbers between two inputs.
var sumRange = function (num1, num2) {

}


console.log(sumRange(10,20));
// Interesting solution involves an algorithm where the sum of all numbers from 0 to a positive number is equal to the equation (n * (n + 1)) / 2
// Figure out the correct correct code.
