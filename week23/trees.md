#Trees

Breadth First Search and Depth First Search:
The point of BFS or DFS is to visit each node exactly once.
BFS is better for deep trees.
DFS is better for wide trees.

#Tries
Meaning is encoded in each node.
Used for predictive text - options are limited by depth on tree.

#B-Tree
B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. Unlike a binary tree, a node in the B-tree can have much more than two children (Comer 1979, p. 123). Unlike self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. It is commonly used in databases and filesystems to make lookup of data faster.

#AVL Tree
AVL (or height-balanced) binary search tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions
