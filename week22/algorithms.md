#Algorithms

##Explain what is an algorithm
An algorithm is a well defined, step by step computational procedure for solving a problem.

Algorithms:

have a goal (deterministic),
terminate at some point in time,
take an input, and
produce output.

##Explain how algorithms are measured
Correctness, Speed, and Memory footprint.

##Explain what is Big O Notation
- Identify Big O Notation of several algorithms - n is input size.
O(n) / Linear Time - the runtime of the application will be linear in relationship to the input size. Basically, when you loop over an entire set once.

O(1) / Constant Time - The algorithm does not vary based on the size of the input.

O(n^2) / Quadratic time - As the number of elements grows, the more time the algorithm will take to execute. The first n*n (n^2) comes from the while loop that iterates over all of the elements in the array and has another while loop inside that also iterates over all elements in the array. The second n comes from the final while loop that iterates over all elements and removes odds.
