Install packages locally in almost all use cases.
One exception is when the package comes with an executable that you want to run from the command line in many different folders.

npm init to create package json
npm install -S (shorthand for --save)
npm install -D (short hand for --save-dev)
create custom scripts in the package.json to execute scripts locally.

NPM dependencies are node modules that are used to run the code.
NPM development dependencies are node modules that are used during development but not in production.

npm install -D eslint eslint-config-ryansobol

npm outdated - to check dependency updates....
