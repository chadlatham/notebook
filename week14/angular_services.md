#Angular Services
##Explain what an Angular services is.
An Angular service is a singleton object that is used in the global scope to share data and data acquiring/manipulation logic between controllers.

##Explain the difference between Angular services and factories.
  - The service service uses a constructor function.
  - The factory service returns an object. Focus on factories for now. ES6 uses service more often because it follows the this.property syntax.
  - Providers are factories that instantiate before the app starts. More popular with ES2015 syntax.
