#Soft Skills Presentation
Tell me about yourself...
  I'm a systems administrator who used scripting on the job to automate my work. I found that I really loved the problem solving and research involved in scripting, so I started studying programming several years ago. About 6 months ago I decided to make a career change and by enrolling in Galvanize and studying JavaScript and full-stack web development using the PEAN stack. I'm passionate about learning and solving problems with coding.

Why are you making a career change?


Why do you want to work here?

What are you looking for?
  I'm looking to be part of a development team where I can apply my current skills and continue to learn from senior developer.

Why should I hire you?
  Not only do I have the skills to perform well in this job, but I have a degree in business administration and a prior career as a systems administrator. My time as an admin involved plenty of direct contact with internal and external customers, coworkers, and the public. I've found that I enjoy communicating with people and working on teams to build the best products achievable.

How do you do working on a team?
  - Give an example of how I resolved a problem in team dynamics.
  I enjoy working on teams as it exposes me to people who think in different ways from myself. For example, when I was pair programming at Galvanize, I would present a concept to another person, and get asked questions regarding scenarios regarding a function's usage that I had not considered which allowed me to make the function more general and useful.

What are your weaknesses?
  - Ice cream and cute puppies. :)
  - I'm not a morning person.
  - Getting too focused on one task and forget about others... To resolve this, I've started making todo lists and keeping track of my progress on the various tasks I'm working on. - I've found the GitHub Issue tracker is a great way to document programming issues.
  - Public speech - To make improvements in this area, I frequently volunteer for speeches on topics that I am very comfortable with to help me gain the familiarity of speaking in public and to know my audience better.
