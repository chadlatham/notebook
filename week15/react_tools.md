#React Tools
##Explain what React JSX is.
JSX, or JavaScript XML, is an JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to HTML. React JSX lets you create ReactElement objects using an HTML-like syntax and a transpiler.

A traditional compiler translates the source code of one programming language into another programming language of a different level of abstraction.

A transpiler is a special type of compiler. Given the source code of one programming language, a transpiler produces equivalent source code in another programming language of approximately the same level of abstraction.

##Explain why React JSX is important.
React JSX allows presentation and behavior to live side-by-side using the power of JavaScript, but with a concise and familiar syntax. Simply put, JSX makes building React user interfaces easier.

1. Presentation and behavior are intimately tied together, so why keep them in separate HTML and JavaScript files.
2. Dedicated template languages tend to be inadequate when implementing a complex user interface.

##Explain what the React Developer Tools are.
React Dev. Tools are a plugin for Chrome (and Firefox?) that looks similar to the element view but gives you access to the state and props of the React components in a page.

##Explain why the React Developer Tools are important.
They let you explore the React structure and modify the state that is laid on top of the DOM.


##Use the React Developer Tools to inspect and debug a user interface.
.map files are critical to translate the transpiled location of error to the source.
