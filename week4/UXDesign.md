#UX Design
User interface is the methods users use to input - keyboard, mouse, voice, touch...

The end goal of user interface design is to make the user's interactions as efficient as possible.

With UI design, simplicity and clarity are paramount.

##UI design is about creating an intuitive, efficient, simplistic, and transparent layer that a user interacts with to operate a program or use a device.

Consistency is very important across a site to provide a sense of one page belonging with another.

A good user interface has consistent usage and appearance of form controls.

A good user interface employs common design patterns for navigation that are intuitive to the user.

Common patterns:
1. user profile info in upper right
2. logo in upper left that links back to homepage
3. breadcrumbs - your location in the website
4. hamburger on mobiles
5. top nav is primary
6. bottom/side nav is secondary
7. pagination
8. informational messages - tooltips - feedforward design

Consider what's most important to the page and put those elements on the top.
