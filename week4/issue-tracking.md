#Issue Tracking
Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they're buried beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics. -Steve McConnell
Issue tracking helps uncover bugs in requirements, design, or even specifications.

Code review is done by a senior developer, team lead, maintainers of open source code base, testing/QA teams...

States of issues: Incomplete ----- Complete
Open, resolved, closed, reopened
Many issue trackers have many more states than GitHub. GitHub is light weight.
Pivotal tracker is a more complex tracking program.

##Components of issue tracking:
1. Capturing - Centralized place to track issues for all team members
2. Recording - What did we decide? When did we decide that? Who decided that? Documentation of decision making.
3. Accountability - Who's responsible? Who said what? When did they say it?
4. Prioritization - What's next? What's most important?
5. Resolving - What was the solution? How did we fix that?

Having a formal testing phase is the last chance to catch issues before costs skyrocket to fix them.
Issue trackers help you find more issues earlier in the development process.
Issue trackers help get non-technical team members involved in the process.

Don't have develpers test their own code for the same reasons you can't proofread your own writing.
Have a specific period of time dedicated to fixing code.

Cross platform issues are common because developers spend most of their time developing in their primary development environment.


##User stories
Short 1-2 sentence stories that describe your user's problem

Agile user stories can be written at various levels of detail. They are known as epics.

The epic can be split into smaller user stories before it is worked on - dozens or possibly hundreds.

User stories should include the context of the user ie... As a user, I would like to be able to do this... As a developer, I would like to be able to do this... As a power user, I would like this...
