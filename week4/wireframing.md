#Wireframing
Planning your project
The purpose of this exercise is to craft a story that will drive your subsequent design decisions.

##Your starting point
Problem / pain point, observation

Data set

game/art/experience


##Framing a user story
Who would use your product?


In what context / when?


##Creating a primary user flow
How would your user use your product/solution?


Frame your idea - outline your primary use case

Build a site map - shows the interconnectivity of pages through the links

Wireframing - low, mid/high fidelity (includes text and some layout), mockup (includes color, layout)

Sketch is a design tool for the creation of digital products

Common navigation patterns: Hamburger, Top Navigation, SideMap

common content patterns: carousel

common principles - feedback (after a user action) and feedforward (set the expectations about taking an action) example: rollover animation. Course correction: when you add something to a cart, how to delete without starting over - avoid the pain of bounceback to a form.

Build a paper prototype then have someone test the prototype in the context of your primary user.
